# Lightweight Drone and Obstacle Map Plot
## Usage
Upon download you will need to run 'viewer.py' and type 'yes' to download the a map for the first time; you'll need internet!
After the map is downloaded you do not need to redownload the map. Unless you are looking for a map of a different area.

### To plot drone's location
There is an example code in viewer.py, see that first.

I'll give more concrete instructions

### To plot obstacles
Still working on the feature.

## Errors
i'll slowly fill this section out.
